    "# GSM8K evaluation using Gemma\n",
    "\n",
    "The [GSM8K dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14168.pdf) presents a good evaluation challenge for small models for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conceptual Simplicity:** While the problems in GSM8K require multi-step reasoning, they primarily involve elementary mathematical concepts and basic arithmetic operations. This makes the dataset accessible to smaller models that may not have the capacity to handle complex mathematical reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linguistic Diversity:** GSM8K emphasizes linguistic diversity, ensuring that problems are not simply variations of the same template. This forces models to generalize their understanding of language and mathematical concepts, rather than relying on superficial pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moderate Difficulty:** The problems in GSM8K are challenging enough to test the limits of small models without being completely intractable. This allows for meaningful evaluation and comparison of different models and methods within a reasonable difficulty range.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Natural Language Solutions:** GSM8K provides solutions in natural language, encouraging models to develop verbal analytical skills and produce human-interpretable reasoning steps. This is particularly relevant for smaller models that may struggle with purely symbolic or equation-based solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on grade-school math concepts and emphasizing linguistic diversity, GSM8K provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating the informal reasoning abilities of smaller language models and identifying areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2B Gemma checkpoint achieves a score of 19%, which is a higher result than obtained using [much larger competing checkpoints](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/arithmetic-reasoning-on-gsm8k)."

    "A: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah's sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.\n",

    "Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?\n",
    "A: He has 5 toys. He got 2 from mom, so after that he has 5 + 2 = 7 toys. Then he got 2 more from dad, so in total he has 7 + 2 = 9 toys. The answer is 9.\n",

    "- Overtime pay per shift: 2 hours * $27.00/hour = $54.00\n",

    "A: ## Ambiguity in the Problem Statement:\n",

    "There is one main ambiguity in the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total volume vs. Number of servings:** The statement \"18 total cups of this drink\" could be interpreted in two ways:\n",
    "  * **18 cups of the combined volume:** This would mean Abigail used a total of 18 cups of liquid, including both iced tea and lemonade.\n",
    "  * **18 individual servings:** This would mean Abigail made 18 individual drinks, each containing 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 1/4 cup of lemonade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume the interpretation \"18 cups of the combined volume\".\n",

    "* Iced tea: 1/4 cup\n",

Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n",
