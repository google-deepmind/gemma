# Gemma

[Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of open-weights Large Language
Model (LLM) by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), based on Gemini
research and technology.

This repository contains an inference implementation and examples, based on the
[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

### Learn more about Gemma

-   The Gemma technical report
    ([v1](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/technical-report),
    [v2](http://goo.gle/gemma2report))
    details the models' capabilities.
-   For tutorials, reference implementations in other ML frameworks, and more,
    visit https://ai.google.dev/gemma.

## Quick start

### Installation

1.  To install Gemma you need to use Python 3.10 or higher.

2.  Install JAX for CPU, GPU or TPU. Follow instructions at
    [the JAX website](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

3.  Run

```
python -m venv gemma-demo
. gemma-demo/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma.git
```

### Downloading the models

The model checkpoints are available through Kaggle at
http://kaggle.com/models/google/gemma. Select one of the **Flax** model
variations, click the â¤“ button to download the model archive, then extract the
contents to a local directory. 

Alternatively, visit the [gemma]([https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma.cpp](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma_jax))
models on the Hugging Face Hub. To download the model, you can run the following code if you have `huggingface_hub` installed:

```
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

local_dir = snapshot_download(repo_id="google/gemma-2b-flax")
snapshot_download(repo_id="google/gemma-2b-flax", local_dir=local_dir)
```

In both cases, the archive contains both the model weights and
the tokenizer, for example the 2b Flax variation contains:

```
2b/              # Directory containing model weights
tokenizer.model  # Tokenizer
```

### Running the unit tests

To run the unit tests, install the optional `[test]` dependencies (e.g. using
`pip install -e .[test]` from the root of the source tree), then:

```
pytest .
```

Note that the tests in `sampler_test.py` are skipped by default since no
tokenizer is distributed with the Gemma sources. To run these tests, download a
tokenizer following the instructions above, and update the `_VOCAB` constant in
`sampler_test.py` with the path to `tokenizer.model`.

## Examples

To run the example sampling script, pass the paths to the weights directory and
tokenizer:

```
python examples/sampling.py \
  --path_checkpoint=/path/to/archive/contents/2b/ \
  --path_tokenizer=/path/to/archive/contents/tokenizer.model
```

There are also several Colab notebook tutorials:

-   [`colabs/sampling_tutorial.ipynb`](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/gemma/blob/main/colabs/sampling_tutorial.ipynb)
    contains a [Colab](http://colab.google) notebook with a sampling example.

-   [`colabs/fine_tuning_tutorial.ipynb`](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/gemma/blob/main/colabs/fine_tuning_tutorial.ipynb)
    contains a [Colab](http://colab.google) with a basic tutorial on how to fine
    tune Gemma for a task, such as English to French translation.

-   [`colabs/gsm8k_eval.ipynb`](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/google-deepmind/gemma/blob/main/colabs/gsm8k_eval.ipynb)
    is a [Colab](http://colab.google) with a reference GSM8K eval
    implementation.

To run these notebooks you will need to download a local copy of the weights and
tokenizer (see above), and update the `ckpt_path` and `vocab_path` variables
with the corresponding paths.

## System Requirements

Gemma can run on a CPU, GPU and TPU. For GPU, we recommend a 8GB+ RAM on GPU for
the 2B checkpoint and 24GB+ RAM on GPU for the 7B checkpoint.
